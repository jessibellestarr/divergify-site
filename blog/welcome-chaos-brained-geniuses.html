    <div class="card" style="padding:18px 16px;">
      <p>I’m just going to say it straight: the world was not built for neurodivergent people. Not for the innovators whose minds light up like constellations. Not for the ones who solve problems sideways, diagonally, and in spirals. Definitely not for the people with 84 browser tabs open and absolutely no intention of closing a single one.</p>
      <p>And yet, we’re the ones who push humanity forward.</p>
      <p>So we built Divergify for the people the world still hasn’t figured out how to appreciate properly: the neurodivergent superminds, the chaos-brained geniuses, the folks who think faster than everyone else can process.</p>
      <p><strong>Divergify isn’t a productivity app. It’s a movement.</strong> A rebellion. A new operating system for the next evolution of brains.</p>
      <p>We’re here to bridge the gap between how your mind works and how the world expects you to operate. And honestly? We’re doing it with more swagger, science, and soul than anyone else even dares to try.</p>

      <h2>Why Divergify Exists</h2>
      <p>Let’s be real for a second. Traditional productivity tools feel like they were coded by people who have never once lost their keys while holding them, or wandered into a room and just... forgot their entire existence.</p>
      <p>We wanted something that actually understands how a neurodivergent mind fires. Something that doesn’t fight your wiring, but harnesses it.</p>
      <p>So Divergify was born out of a simple truth:</p>
      <p><strong>Your neurodivergent brain is not broken. The world’s outdated software is.</strong></p>
      <p>And until society catches up, we’re building the tools that help you thrive right now.</p>

      <h2>The Divergify Philosophy: Neurodivergence Is the Next Evolution</h2>
      <p>We don’t tiptoe around neurodivergence as if it’s a medical footnote. We celebrate it as the superpower it is.</p>
      <p>Your brain is a high-speed, multidimensional, pattern-detecting, intuitive machine. You see connections others miss. You innovate without trying. You feel deeply, imagine vividly, and solve creatively.</p>
      <p>That’s not a disadvantage. That’s a future advantage.</p>
      <p>Divergify’s entire mission is to help you use that power without burning out, melting down, or getting buried under the mountain of life admin that seems insultingly easy for everyone else.</p>

      <h2>The Science Behind the Movement</h2>
      <p>We built Divergify using behavioral science from experts like Chase Hughes, weaving in habit-building strategies that actually stick to neurodivergent brains instead of sliding off them like a fried egg on a non-stick pan.</p>
      <p>This isn’t therapy. Not treatment. Not a cure.</p>
      <p>This is tactical self-brainwashing to help you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stick to habits without white-knuckling</li>
        <li>Organize your life without losing your spark</li>
        <li>Get things done without sacrificing the creativity that makes you unstoppable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’re not here to tame you. We’re here to equip you.</p>

      <h2>The Tools That Make Divergify Different</h2>
      <h3>The Integrated Calendar That Doesn’t Judge You</h3>
      <p>Plan your day visually, intuitively, and without that “you should’ve started this three hours ago” guilt trip. It syncs with your energy rhythms, not societal expectations.</p>
      <h3>Map Integration for People Who Can’t Handle Another Wrong Turn</h3>
      <p>Need to get somewhere but your brain is chaos? Divergify overlays your tasks with travel routes so you stop wasting energy on logistics and start saving it for brilliance.</p>
      <h3>Shopping List Mode That Keeps You From Wandering Into The Clearance Aisle</h3>
      <p>You walk into the store for tomatoes and walk out with a Himalayan salt lamp. We know. Shopping List Mode keeps you laser-focused in the aisles so you stop playing fetch with your attention span.</p>
      <h3>Beat Your Baseline: The Distraction Blocker Designed for ADHD Minds</h3>
      <p>Instead of punishing you for losing focus, it challenges you to beat your own past performance. It gamifies your brain’s natural dopamine hunger in the smartest way possible.</p>
      <h3>The Gentle Nudge Assistant That Doesn’t Nag You</h3>
      <p>You get encouragement, not punishment. Nudges that feel like a supportive friend tapping your shoulder, not a judgmental manager breathing down your neck.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision: A World That Finally Gets Us</h2>
      <p>We’re not building an app. We’re building a revolution.</p>
      <p>A world where neurodivergent people aren’t gaslit into thinking they’re “too much,” “too messy,” or “too scattered.” A world that recognizes the brilliance behind the chaos. A world that updates its systems to match our minds instead of forcing us to dim ourselves to match theirs.</p>
      <p>We want Divergify to become the home base for every out-of-the-box thinker who’s ever felt like a glitch in the system. You’re not a glitch. You’re the upgrade.</p>

      <h2>Where We’re Going Next</h2>
      <p>We’re dreaming big. Too big for some people’s comfort, which is exactly how we like it.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we’re building toward:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full sensory-friendly interfaces</li>
        <li>AI-supported routine builders (that actually work for neurodivergent energy cycles)</li>
        <li>Community spaces for chaos-brains to collaborate instead of isolate</li>
        <li>More behavioral science tools to help turn habits into second nature</li>
        <li>Extensions into school, workplace, and accessibility systems</li>
        <li>A global movement that forces society to evolve with us instead of around us</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This isn’t a startup. This is a rebellion disguised as software. And you’re part of it.</p>

      <h2>A Final Note From the Future</h2>
      <p>If you’re reading this, it means you’re tired of forcing your brain into boxes that never fit. It means you’re ready for tools built for people who think in constellations, not checklists.</p>
      <p>Divergify is here to give you structure without sabotage, habits without shame, and focus without losing the spark that makes you powerful.</p>
      <p><strong>Your brain isn’t the problem. The system is. We’re here to rewrite it.</strong></p>
      <p>Welcome to Divergify. Welcome to the movement. Let’s build the future our minds were born for.</p>
