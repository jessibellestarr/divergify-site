      <p>
        Divergify was born out of exhaustion — the kind that comes from trying to
        jam a loud, nonlinear, brilliant brain into tools built for quiet,
        linear, neurotypical workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of forcing neurodivergent people to contort themselves around
        rigid systems, we’re building tools that flex around real human brains:
        ADHD, autism, trauma, sensory overwhelm, executive dysfunction and all.
      </p>
      <p>
        We pair research on executive function, dopamine, and sensory load with
        practical experiments in the wild. The result: systems that don’t rely
        on willpower alone, but on smart scaffolding, gentle nudges, and
        honest feedback.

      <p>
        Neurodivergent brains are high-bandwidth. The problem isn’t the ideas;
        it’s holding all the threads at once without burning out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divergify uses AI to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Catch ideas before they vanish.</li>
        <li>Turn spirals into step-by-step plans.</li>
        <li>Remember the boring details so you don’t have to.</li>
        <li>Give you structure without taking your autonomy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We believe the future looks like humans + AI working together,
        not humans being graded by machines. Divergify is our way of making
        that future feel possible, ethical, and actually usable.
