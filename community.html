<h1>Divergify Signal Station</h1>

<p>
If you landed here, your brain probably did not read the manual on how it was “supposed” to work. It runs loud, fast, sideways, whatever. You notice things other people walk right past. That is not a bug. That is the whole point.
</p>

<p>
This space is for the people who overthink in three directions at once, start sidequests by accident, and wake up mid Sparkstorm. You do not have to make that pretty for anyone here.
</p>

<p>
What you can do in this corner of the internet
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ask the questions your brain refuses to drop</li>
  <li>Dump the mess out of your head and call it a Brain Dump</li>
  <li>Swap ideas with other signal seekers who get your kind of chaos</li>
  <li>Admit you are tired and still trying anyway</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is one rule that actually matters  
<strong>Respect people. If you are dragging others backward or starting drama, we will shut that shit down.</strong>
</p>

<p>
Introduce yourself however you want. A sentence. A spiral. A late night ramble you almost deleted. Whatever version of you shows up is the one that belongs here.
</p>

<p>
We are not here to squeeze into an old system that never worked for us in the first place. We are here to build what comes next, one small weird conversation at a time.
</p>

<p>
Also yes, there is probably a Dopamine Gremlin watching. Do not feed it nonsense. It already has enough.
