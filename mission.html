        Divergify exists to redefine what it means to think differently. We believe neurodivergent minds aren’t
        defects to be managed down. They’re adaptations — the next iteration of human problem-solving,
        creativity, intuition, and resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world wasn’t built for us, but the future will be. Our job is to build the tools, language, and
        community that make that future possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Divergify combines emotionally intelligent AI with human-centered design to create a bridge between the
        way our brains work and the way the world demands we function. Not a replacement for human brilliance —
        a scaffold that lets it stand taller and shake fewer loose screws.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re building systems that adapt to real brains, not imaginary "ideal" ones. Technology that supports
        instead of shames. A shared vocabulary in <strong>Divergipedia</strong>, a community that lifts each
        other instead of masking alone, and tools that turn survival mode into something closer to a life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans + AI working together — not humans being graded by machines or quietly repurposed as
        Matrix‑grade biofuel. Anyone worried about that: same.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more than an app. It’s a movement. And every neurospicy brain that lands here is part of where
        we’re heading next.
